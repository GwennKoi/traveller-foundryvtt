# Computers

Computers can be embedded in several different item types.

Let's just assume that they can be embedded in anything which is a physical object.
They have processing power.
They need to have a list of software.
They need an interface.

The interface is just a software type. We could either hardcode in the interface, or just treat it as a type of software.

What are the software types?
  * Interface
  * Expert System - we already have rules for this.
  * Generic (not set game rules)
  * Task Bonus - similar to skill augment.
