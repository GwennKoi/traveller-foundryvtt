# Computers

Computers can be embedded in several different item types.

Let's just assume that they can be embedded in anything which is a physical object.
They have processing power.
They need to have a list of software.
They need an interface.

The interface is just a software type. We could either hardcode in the interface, or just
treat it as a type of software.

What are the software types?
  * Interface
  * Security - Provides extra security for the computer.
  * Expert System - we already have rules for this.
  * Generic (no set game rules)
  * Task Bonus - similar to skill augment.


## Ship Software

There are tasks for which software is needed, or which it gives a bonus to.

### Ship Tasks

  * Make a jump
  * Evade
  * Fire Control
  * Auto-Repair
